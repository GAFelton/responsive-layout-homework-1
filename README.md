### Description

This assignment involved using Bootstrap's mobile-first framework to create a responsive portfolio website. I was tasked with creating three pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

I used bootstrap elements as the basic framework for each page:
`index.html`: `navbar` for the header, `card` for the "About Me" Section, `navbar` for the footer.
`portfolio.html`: `navbar` for the header, `cards` for the project cards, `navbar` for the footer.
`contact.html`: `navbar` for the header, `input group` for the contact form, `navbar` for the footer.

I added to the basic bootstrap styles with my own CSS styles.
